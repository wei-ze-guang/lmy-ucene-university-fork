// # Lucene file content (with SimpleTextCodec)
//
// This worked example helps explain what data structures exist in a Lucene index and how they are stored (albeit with
// a text representation -- the real implementations use very compact binary files).
//
// Unlike some other examples, the interesting part is not the code, but rather the output, which is included below
// the `DirectoryFileContents` class.
//
// There are a number of changes that can be made to this example to make it more interesting (at the expense of
// producing files too large to walk through here). Readers are encouraged to modify the `createDocuments` method
// to add other field types, add more documents, etc.

// ## Program output
//
// The program dumps the following files. Let's explore the files one-by-one.
//
// Note that the SimpleTextCodec is an implementation that is conceptually similar to the real binary codecs, but
// certainly // not identical. There are compromises that SimpleTextCodec has made to implement a fully-functioning
// codec in plain text.

// ### Doc values
//
// The `.dat` file stores the doc values for the `val` field.
//
// The `IntField` uses the "binary" doc values format. In this case, each value has a maximum length of 1 byte.
// The "maxlength" and "pattern" values let us efficiently seek to the start of a document's values. Specifically,
// relative to the start of the ddc values (i.e. the byte following the newline after `pattern 0`), a given document's
// values start at `startOffset + (9 + pattern.length + maxlength + 2) * docNum` (taken from the Javadoc for
// `SimpleTextDocValuesFormat`).
//
// Each document's entry has a `length`, specifying how many doc values are present in the document. In our case,
// each document has a single value for `val`, except the second document, which has none.
//
// Each Lucene file has a trailing `checksum` used to verify the file integrity and protect against flipped bits.

// ### Points
//
// The `.dii` file stores an index to locate the point data for individual fields in the `.dim` file. In this case,
// the point tree for the field `val` starts at byte 113 in the `.dim` file.
//
// That byte corresponds to the line `num data dims 1`. The contents of the file before that are the "blocks" in the
// "block K-d" tree, corresponding to leaves of the tree. In this case, since we only have 3 documents with points,
// they all fit in a single block. The offset of this leaf is specified as part of the tree definition, in the line
// `block fp 0` (i.e. the block starts at byte 0 of the file).

//
// The `.inf` file stores information about each field.
//
// Note that many of the properties (e.g. `vector encoding` and `vector similarity`) are not applicable to the fields
// that we added. The values shown here are the field defaults. Several of the data structures are only created
// for a field if some property is set. For example, vectors are only written for fields where the
// "vector number of dimensions" is greater than zero. Doc values are only written when the doc values type for a field
// is not `NONE`. See the `IndexingChain.processField` method to see exactly how field type values decide what
// structures get written to an index for a field based on the field type properties.

// ### Norms
//
// The `.len` file contains the norms for each text field in the index. The norms are the length (relative to term
// positions) of a text field in each document containing that field.
//
// In this case, we have a single text field called `text`. The norms are encoded as a "delta" from the shortest
// document in the segment. In this case, our shortest document is the second one with length 5 (represented as 00
// more than the `minvalue`). The longest document is the third one with length 15 (i.e. 10 more than `minValue`).

// ### Postings
//
// The postings, stored in `.pst` files, are the key data structure used for efficient text search in Lucene.
//
// Postings are organized from field to term to matching documents. In this case, since the `text` field was indexed
// with `DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS` (see the "Field infos" section above), each document entry for a term encodes
// the frequency of the term in the document (used in scoring calculations), as well as the positions at which the
// term can be found in the document (used for phrase and span queries).
//
// While many of the terms in our example occur in a single position in a single document, look at the postings for
// the term `the`, which appears in 3 documents, in multiple positions for each.

// ### Segment info
//
// The segment info file `.si` stores information about all the other files involved in a segment.
//
// While the segment info file is managed by the codec, the SimpleTextSegmentInfoFormat implementation currently
// outputs the raw bytes for the segment's unique ID, so it is not a valid UTF-8 encoding.
// See https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/12897.
File _0.si has size 739

// ### Commit file
//
// Each commit increments the commit generation and writes a `segments_<generation>` file. When indexing from a single
// thread with regular commits, the commit generation will often match the ordinal of the last segment (since each
// counts up by one on each commit). If segments are flushed without committing or flushed from multiple threads,
// the segment numbers will usually be higher than the commit generation.
//
// The commit file holds the "SegmentInfos" (plural). It is not managed by the codec, since it encodes the information
// about what segments are part of the given commit and which codecs were used to write each segment. Since the
// file was not written by SimpleTextCodec, it is a binary file, so we don't output it here.
File segments_1 has size 156

// ### Write lock
//
// On creation of the `IndexWriter`, a `write.lock` file is created and locked. The lock implementation is configurable,
// but is usually based on a `java.nio.channels.FileLock`.
//
// The write lock ensures that no more than one IndexWriter is ever writing to the same directory.
