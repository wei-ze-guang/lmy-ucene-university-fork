// # Conjunctive Boolean query (AND) internals
//
// This example partly builds on top of the concepts introduced in `BooleanQueryIntro`, so I suggest you go check
// that example first.
//
// If you happen to have arrived here through a web search, please **DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS CODE**. Lucene already
// has a BooleanQuery class. See the neighboring `BooleanQueryIntro` example for some guidance on using it.
//
// This example digs into some of the implementation details for Boolean queries, specifically conjunctive (`AND`)
// queries. Since Lucene's real Boolean queries are quite sophisticated, most of this example will involve building
// our own version of a Boolean query that behaves like a binary "AND" operator. That is, it has exactly two clauses,
// which are both required (and participate in scoring). Along the way, we'll learn some things about how Lucene
// queries in general are implemented, and how Boolean queries implement "leap-frogging".
//
// Before we get into the code, here is an overview of the chain of classes we need to implement for our own query:
// 1. `Query`: A query represents the instruction for *what* we want to match/score, without getting into the details
//             of *how* we're going to do so.
// 2. `Weight`: Returned by the `createWeight` method on the query. The JavaDoc for `Weight` says, "The purpose of
//             Weight is to ensure searching does not modify a Query, so that a Query instance can be reused." While
//             the `Query` is independent of any index state, the `Weight` is constructed based on the current
//             `IndexSearcher`, and properties of the search action (e.g. whether scoring is needed).
// 3. `Scorer`: For each index segment, the `Weight` creates a `Scorer`. The `Scorer` may be used once to step through
//             matching documents in the segment (via its embedded `DocIdSetIterator` -- explained next), and returns
//             the score (at this query's level) for the document.
// 4. `DocIdSetIterator`: A `DocIdSetIterator` (often abbreviated to DISI) steps through matching document IDs for the
//             given segment in increasing order. Many DISIs support an efficient `advance(int n)` method that returns
//             the matching doc ID greater than or equal to `n`.
